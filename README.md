# Apriori-Algorithm For Market Basket Analysis
![Market Basket](https://github.com/ChiragJRana/Apriori-Algorithm-from-Scratch/tree/master/trash/MarketBasket.jpg?raw=true)
Apriori uses a "bottom up" approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time (a step known as candidate generation), and groups of candidates are tested against the data. The algorithm terminates when no further successful extensions are found.
